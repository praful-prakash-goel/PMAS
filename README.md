# Predictive Maintenance Automation System (PMAS)

## 📌 Overview
The **Predictive Maintenance Automation System (PMAS)** is an intelligent system designed to predict potential equipment failures before they occur by analyzing operational and maintenance data.  
The system helps organizations minimize unexpected breakdowns, reduce maintenance costs, and improve overall system reliability.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Predict machine or equipment failures in advance
- Reduce unplanned downtime
- Optimize maintenance schedules
- Improve equipment lifespan and reliability
- Automate maintenance decision making

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture
PMAS follows a modular and layered architecture consisting of:
1. **Data Collection Layer** – Gathers historical and real-time operational data  
2. **Data Processing Layer** – Cleans, transforms, and prepares data  
3. **Prediction Engine** – Estimates the likelihood of future failures  
4. **Alert & Notification Layer** – Generates maintenance alerts  
5. **User Interface Layer** – Displays insights and system status
