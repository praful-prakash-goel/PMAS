# Usecase Diagram

![](Usecase_diagram.png)

### Aim of the Use Case Diagram (Predictive Maintenance System):

To illustrate how different users interact with the Predictive Maintenance Automation System to monitor machine health, collect and analyze sensor data, predict failures, detect anomalies, generate alerts, and manage maintenance activities efficiently—thereby reducing downtime, preventing unexpected failures, and optimizing maintenance operations.

## 1. Actors

### 1.1 Human Actors

- **User**  
  A generalized actor representing all human users of the system.

- **Technician**  
  Logs into the system, views assigned maintenance tickets, updates ticket status, and performs maintenance activities.

- **System Administrator**  
  Manages user access, registers technicians, manages machines, views alerts, and creates or updates maintenance tickets to ensure smooth system operation.

---

### 1.2 External System Actors

- **System (Automated Monitoring Service)**  
  Periodically monitors machine health and automatically generates alerts and maintenance tickets if a machine behaves abnormally, without any human intervention.
